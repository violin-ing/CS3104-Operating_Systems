Write a program that opens the file /usr/share/dict/words
(or whatever the equivalent path is on your system),
and displays the first n lines, where n is specified as a
command-line parameter.

- Example: $ ./words 5
    1080
    10-point
    10th
    11-point
    12-point
    
- Hint: use atoi for parsing the command-line parameter.
- Bonus: write your own implementation of atoi.
- Note: try to implement robust error checking.


=== TASKS ===
1. Write the program in C, using the the fopen()/fgets()/fclose() family of functions.
2. Write the program in C++, using iostream.
3. Write the program in C, using the open()/read()/close() family of functions.
4. Write the program in C, using the open()/mmap()/close()/munmap() family of functions.
5. Write the program in C, using the syscall() function. You will need to explore how
syscalls are implemented.
6. Write the program in x86 assembly language, using the syscall instruction to 
communicate with the kernel. You will need to find out the raw system call numbers:

For the above, you can use the likes of printf/putchar e.g. for display – what’s important is
reading the input file using the specified methods.

=== DISCUSSION === 
Even if you don’t manage to complete the implementations, investigate each
strategy for reading from files, and learn about what makes each approach different 
from the other.
